WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net design_2_i/MemorEDF_0/inst/nonaxidomain/dispatcher/E[0]_bufg_place is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_2_i/MemorEDF_0/inst/nonaxidomain/dispatcher/values[15][245]_i_1/O, cell design_2_i/MemorEDF_0/inst/nonaxidomain/dispatcher/values[15][245]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
