\section{Conclusion}
%    In this article, we have highlighted the existence of an enigmatic source of inter-core interference in the ARM Cortex-A53 clusters caused by isolated and delayed read transactions.
%    The interference has been observed to increase the execution time of co-runners by a factor of 10 in the worst case despite all the precautions taken to eliminate known sources of interferences.
%    Even worst, the experiment shows that in the most extreme case, the whole core cluster can be stalled, jeopardizing any isolation and putting the satefy of the system at risk.
%
%    Extensions of this work will focus on strengthening the experimental setup, on narrowing down the scope of potential sources of the observed interference and propose a solution to prevent it. In addition, the authors plan to experiment with other wide-spread ARM Cortex CPUs to see whether the issue is specific to the A53 model.
