\section{Conclusion}
    In this article, we have highlighted the existence of an enigmatic source of inter-core interference on the ARM Cortex-A53 caused by isolated unserved read transactions.
    The interference has been observed to increase the execution time of co-running inmate by a factor of 11 despite all the precautions taken to eliminate known sources of interferences.
    Even worst, the experiment shows that in the most extreme case, the whole core cluster can be stalled, jeopardizing any isolation and putting the satefy of the system at risk.

    Future works will focus on strengthening the experimental setup, on narrowing down the scope of potential sources of the observed interference and propose a solution to prevent it. In addition, the authors plan to experiment with other wide spread ARM Cortex models to see if the issue is specific to the A53 model.
