\section{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Such system, under strict conditions cannot quarantee QoS nor Mixed-criticality levels.
        \item In contrast to what has been previously reported, read intensive applications can also become a threat for the system predictability.
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Future works}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Study if the same impact can be found with the attacker targeting a scratch pad memory which frequency could be modify.
            \item Investigate whether this phenomenom can also be observed in other, more recent, ARM core families.
        \end{itemize}
