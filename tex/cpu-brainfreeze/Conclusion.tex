\section{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Such system, under strict conditions cannot quarantee QoS nor Mixed-criticality levels.
        \item In contrast to what has been previously reported, read intensive applications can also become a threat for the system predictability.
        \item Bus slaves must be designed carefully to provide fast answers. More specifically, SoCs featuring a tightly integrated FPGA must ensure that the FPGA can only be reprogrammed by a trusted actor as simply holding a single transaction can indefinitely stall the whole core cluster.
    \end{itemize}
