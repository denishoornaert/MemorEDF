\section{Introduction}


This paper makes the following contributions:
1) We demonstrate that without any modification to the SoC circuitry, a configurable module could be interposed between the core and memory controller to perform traffic shaping. The proposed module operates at the granularity of transactions based on their interarrival time.
2) We perform transaction-level memory scheduling in configurable hardware. Various scheduling policies implemented in the module and could be configured at run-time.

3) A groundbreaking view on memory access scheduling, namely MemorEDF, has been proposed. In this method, the memory is viewed as a single resource .....

4) We provide a run-time profiling interface to log the transaction-level behavior of an application. Recorded data exploited to make and enforce efficient scheduling decisions for EDF and LLF policies.

5) This work implement a sandbox framework to test scheduling platforms on real hardware. Newly proposed scheduling techniques can be evaluated against the actual device, without rewiring the platform.

6) We implement and evaluate a full-stack design that includes the memory scheduler hardware module. Using this implementation, we analyze several well-known scheduling algorithms, namely, Earliest Deadline First (EDF), Least Laxity First (LLF), Time-division multipleaccess (TDMA).
