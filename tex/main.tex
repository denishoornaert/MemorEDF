\begin{abstract}

  For a long period of time, the main focus of safety critical hard real-time systems has been to manage the computation units. However, with the advent of Heterogeneous Multiprocessors system, the critical section of the system has been shifted to the massively shared memory hierarchy, leading to hardly predictable system. While a great deal of theoretical work proposes elegant and efficient scheduling mechanisms taking the memory constraint into account, they often rely on simple memory scheduling policies such as Time Division memory Access that are not natively available on current systems.
  In the present article, we propose SchIM, a hardware level scheduler offering the well studied and predictable memory scheduling policies. The proposed framework takes advantage of a tightly coupled Programmable logic block available on newly available COTS platforms. Through many experiments, we characterised the performance of the implemented hardware scheduler and verify both its correct behaviour and its capability of ensuring core isolation.



  VERSION TWO:

  Traditionally, the main focus of safety-critical hard real-time systems was to manage the non deterministic contention over shared resources. With the advent of the Heterogeneous Multiprocessors system, the criticality has been shifted toward the memory hierarchy, as it becomes the main source of unmanaged contention.  In this regard, on-chip integration of programmable logic (PL) alongside conventional Processing Systems (PS)  in modern Systems-on-Chip (SoC) established aiming to relieve the main processor of some workloads. However, recent studies revealed  more sophisticated implications of harmony of CPUs and a tightly-coupled block of PL than anticipated. The potential of adopting the PL on-chip yields to PL-aided memory traffic management.
  This paper explores a novel method of applying reconfigurability techniques to provide a  memory traffic scheduling mechanism, namely, \schim. We demonstrate that using \schim; a transaction-level administration could be leveraged to devise a programmable memory scheduling infrastructure. Focusing on extensibility and reconfigurability, SchIM is twofold. First, it provides a safe playground to test innovative scheduling impressions; and second, SchIM transacts as an intermediate turning point for manufacturers, demanding strict determinism over memory performance. 



  
%% The advent of the High-resolution, high-bandwidth platforms prompts unprecedented concerns regarding the unpredictability of the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). On-chip integration of programmable logic (PL) alongside conventional Processing Systems (PS)  in modern Systems-on-Chip (SoC) establishes a genuine compromise between specialization,  performance, and re-configurability.  Moreover, the harmony of traditional CPUs and a tightly-coupled block of PL has more sophisticated implications than anticipated. The potential of adopting the PL on-chip yields to a unique capability to observe, regulate, and accelerate the interconnect exchanges at individual transactions' granularity.

%% From a real-time perspective, the challenge in achieving high-resolution real-time systems detriments by an existent gap in the market, separating promising memory scheduling ideas from their analysis on realistic workloads. This paper explores a novel method of applying reconfigurability techniques to provide a  memory traffic mechanism, namely, \schim. We demonstrate that using \schim; a transaction-leveladministration could be leveraged to devise a programmable memory scheduling infrastructure. Focusing on extensibility and reconfigurability, SchIM is twofold. First, it provides a safe playground to test innovative scheduling impressions; and second, SchIM transacts as an intermediate turning point for manufacturers, demanding strict determinism over memory performance.

%% We evaluate our design through a full system implementation on PS-PL platforms delivered, carrying three pilot memory scheduling policies as a proof-of-concept.

%% As the number of cores on one chip increases rather rapidly, it necessitates schedulers to be reinvented. A challenge in achieving high-resolution real-time systems detriments by an existent gap in the market, separating promising memory scheduling ideas from their analysis on realistic workloads.
