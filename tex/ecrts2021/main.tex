\begin{abstract}


The sharp increase in demand for performance has prompted an explosion
in the complexity of modern multi-core embedded systems. This has lead
to unprecedented temporal unpredictability concerns in Cyber-Physical
Systems (CPS). On-chip integration of programmable logic (PL)
alongside a conventional Processing Systems (PS) in modern
Systems-on-Chip (SoC) establishes a genuine compromise between
specialization, performance, and re-configurability. In addition to
typical use-cases, it has been shown that the PL can be used to
observe, manipulate, and ultimately manage memory traffic generated by
a traditional multi-core processor.

This paper explores the possibility of PL-aided memory scheduling by
proposing a \schimL (\schim). We demonstrate that the \schim enables
transaction-level control over the main memory traffic generated by a
set of embedded cores. Focusing on extensibility and
reconfigurability, we put forward a \schim design covering two main
objectives. First, to provide a safe playground to test innovative
memory scheduling mechanisms; and second, to establish a transition
path from software-based memory regulation to provably correct
hardware-enforced memory scheduling. We evaluate our design through a
full-system implementation on a commercial PS-PL platform using
synthetic and real-world benchmarks.
