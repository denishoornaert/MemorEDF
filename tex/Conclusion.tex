In the present article we introduced the \schim, a memory transactions
scheduler framework that can be integrated in commercially available
platforms featuring a tightly coupled processing system and
programmable logic. Through a set of experiments, we assessed the
capabilities of the framework and demonstrated the correct behaviour
of the proposed scheduling policies, namely Fixed Priority, Time
Division Multiple Access and Traffic Shaping. Finally, we showed using
a suite of real-world benchmarks that the \schim is capable of
enforcing strong temporal isolation in spite of heavy memory
contention.
    
The authors see the proposed \schim as a stepping stone for predictive
memory scheduling. The proposed framework having been design with
extensibility in mind, advanced integration in commercially available
platform as well as advanced scheduling techniques are few of many
possible future directions. Especially, \schim is seen by the authors
as the first step toward profile-based memory access scheduling.
