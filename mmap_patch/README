Kernel 4.9

Use mmap flags directly as numbers as libc is not modified to support new flags
#define MAP_CACHED  0x40 /* Map as cacheable */
#define MAP_OC_INC  0x80 /* Map as Outer Cacheable, Inner non-cacheable */

example: mmap(0, g_mem_size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED | 0x40, memfd, dev_base);
